# c196 THE MOVIE-WAIT GETSTAT DELIVERY - R1300, ONE targeted
# behavior change (the gameplay pivot: produce game play). THE c197 RUN
# RECEIPTS resolve the Jos snapshot question: (1) the armed/idle freeze
# class did NOT recur - the R1298 armstart door fired ZERO (guard held,
# nothing forced, nothing to revert; parked for its class); (2) BOTH
# classes are real, trajectory-dependent: c196 = started-then-stalled
# (sectors 108939-108971 consumed then FDF8=92180 frozen), c197 =
# never-started file#18 (drive never seeked to 109158; defib6 carry
# completed it, dest-held RECEIPTED THE SECOND TIME); (3) the LAST-BLOCKER
# claim is WITHDRAWN - trajectory variance rotates the wedge class.
# THE TERMINAL WEDGE THIS RUN, seq chain COMPLETE for the first time:
# SET (cmd 02 seq 127) -> BLOCKED x4 with every gate term -> defib6
# completed the load -> CLEAR ran (seq 127 receipted) -> the game own
# timeout moved it to FE1C=10/cmd 01 -> BLOCKED x4 (seq 128: cmd=01
# fe1c=10 FDF8=0 seek=3 FE04=109158 A22C=5) -> NO CLEAR, NO DELIVERY to
# the fuse - the notification PROVEN LOST (c351 discipline: scheduled +
# blocked-with-terms + never-cleared, all receipted). THE DEFECT NAMED
# FROM SOURCE: the c169-era R412 cmd-01/fe1c-10 release gate is
# STRUCTURALLY DEAD - nested inside the cmd-02/06 outer conjunction it
# can never match (cmd 02||06 AND cmd 01 = always false), and its
# field-band terms decline the movie posture anyway - the movie-wait
# GetStat has had NO delivery vehicle since c169. THE FIX: R1300 delivers
# the 1-byte ready status 0x02 (the R612/R615 precedent the game
# receipted accepting, R594/Pause psx-spx status byte) + INT3 + the flag
# word, at the receipted posture (cmd 01 + fe1c 10 + FDF8 0 + act 0 +
# pend 0), budget 64, clear-site tracer at L1300. NOTHING ELSE: no FE1C
# writes, no A22C writes (the game clears its own flags - receipted), no
# slotbits event. REVERT: the game stays parked after deliveries = revert
# next cycle. PASS: FE1C moves, new SETs issue, the movie era advances
# (mdec receipts). Base gate 1082fd90 (the c197 provenance tree), patch
# sha b03a1180 (sandbox-verified apply clean, parse clean, 0 -Wformat
# warnings), post-apply e00520d4, backup and restores read .bak1300.
# Bootstrap: fetch, SHA-256 gate, syntax gate, provenance copy, execute.
