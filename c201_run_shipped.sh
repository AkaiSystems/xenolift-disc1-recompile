# c201 THE RUN-ONLY CYCLE - the c200 build is ALREADY APPLIED (cycle 202
# TREE_SHA receipt: 271b6bbf, the patched tree; the drift gate did its job
# and NOTHING ran, no state changed). THE PLAN: (1) gate on the patched
# tree 271b6bbf (no patch fetch - if the tree were the unpatched baseline
# the script says so and stops); (2) -Wformat build gate on the patched
# tree; (3) PRESERVE the existing run.log to a timestamped snapshot
# BEFORE the fresh run overwrites it - it may hold receipts from a prior
# c200 execution (the preservation censuses the R612-release/rspop01/
# rspop13/R1300-absence/mdec markers so we know immediately which era it
# is); (4) the fresh 120s receipt run with alive-guarded captures; (5)
# the FULL decisive-chain digest: CHAIN201 (delivery -> CLEAR -> POP w/
# origin -> INT-ACK pendclr BETWEEN pop and transition -> FE1C chg ->
# new SETs -> mdec), RESCUE201 (per-tag rescue census + the R1300
# retirement absence check), ERA201 (bootmain era census + era-stamped
# line count), plus all standing censuses. THE QUESTION THIS RUN ANSWERS:
# does the GetTN arm deliver the armed TOC answer, does the guest consume
# all 3 bytes (rspop13), does FE1C exit 11, and does the game advance its
# own protocol - or do the blocked-with-terms receipts name the next
# missing transition. A pop without FE1C movement is NOT judged an
# incorrect delivery until the pendclr INT-ack receipts between them are
# read (Jos c200 refinement, in the digest). Bootstrap: fetch, SHA-256
# gate, syntax gate, provenance copy, execute.
